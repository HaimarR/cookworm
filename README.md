**Cookworm** is a social cooking app that I‚Äôm building to bring together recipes, food posts, and a bit of gamification. Right now it‚Äôs still early, but the idea is simple: a place where people can share meals, write recipes, and connect over food.

At the moment, I‚Äôm working on the basics like user accounts, profiles, and authentication. You can already sign up, log in, and update your profile. Next up, I‚Äôm focusing on letting people create posts and recipes so the feed actually has content worth exploring.

In the future, Cookworm will be more than just posting recipes. The plan is to let users manage a pantry of ingredients they already have, then match those ingredients to recipes they can actually cook. If they‚Äôre missing a few items, the app will highlight what‚Äôs missing and even generate a shopping list.

Another part I‚Äôm really excited about is the exploration side. Cookworm will have an achievements map where every time you cook a recipe from a new region, you unlock that part of the world. Over time, this will make cooking feel like a journey where you discover cultures and cuisines while earning badges and hitting streaks.

I also want verified chefs and creators to be part of the community, giving feedback and sharing healthy cooking tips. That way users aren‚Äôt just sharing food, but also learning from people with real experience. Nutrition filters and healthy tags will also be added so users can find meals that fit their diets.

The end goal is for Cookworm to make home cooking easier, healthier, and a lot more fun. Right now it‚Äôs just the foundation, but little by little it‚Äôs growing into a platform that helps people cook more, waste less, and share what they love to eat.
